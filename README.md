# Telco Customer Churn Classification

This project explores a classification model that classifies a customer as either churned or not churned.

## Description
In today's rapidly evolving telecommunications industry, service providers face intense competition, making the retention of existing customers a critical challenge. It is well-known that the cost of acquiring new customers outweighs that of retaining existing ones. To address this challenge, our project aims to develop a churn prediction model to forecast customer attrition and facilitate targeted retention strategies.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient churn prediction model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By proactively identifying potential churners, the telecom company can take timely and personalized actions to retain valuable customers and prevent revenue loss.

## Approach
Our approach involves implementing machine learning techniques for churn prediction. We will explore and compare the performance of two popular algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**From thoroughly examining the dataset, we came out with the following analytical questions:**

* What is the correlation between phone service and churn?
* Do charges contribute to customer churn?
* What is the average tenure of customers?
* How is customer churn aligned with whether a customer has a partner and dependents or not?
* Does being a senior citizen contribute significantly to churn?
* Is customer retention heavily dependent on customer's access to tech support?
* What effect does online security have on tenure?
* What factors/variables significantly contribute to customer churn?

## **Hypothesis Testing**

Hypothesis <br>
_**Null:**_ Total charges do not contribute to the churn rate among customers.<br>
_**Alternate:**_ Total charges significantly contribute to the churn rate among customers.
